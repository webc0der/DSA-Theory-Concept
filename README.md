# DSA-Theory-Concept
theory concepts of DSA

- PhYsical DS:
Array
LinkedList

- Logical DS:
Tree
Hashing
stack
Queue
grap

- Algos:
magic framwork
greedy algo
divide conquer
dynamic programming

- Data Structure:
it is way to organise data in such a way that enable it to process it in efficient time

- Algorithm:
it is set set of rule to be followed to solve a problem

- Primitive data structures:
these are the data structures privided by the programing language, Ex- Interger, float, char , boolean

- Non-Primitive data structures:
this can categorized in two types:
    -> Physical data structure: Array, Linked List
    -> Logical data structures: tree, stack, queue, graph
logical ds have the concept but the implementation is based on in any of the phyical ds
EX- stack can be implmented based on array or linked list and same goes for Queue also

- Recursion:
    -> same operation is performed with different inputs
    -> in every operation we try to minimize the the problem so that we will be closer to reach the solution
    -> in recursive operation it is mandatory to have base condition, and once that condition get satified the recursive opration stops and gives us the solution
    -> recursion can be applied in tree and graph DS.
    -> can be applied in divide and conquer, greedy and dynamic programing, stack, sorting(quick sort, merge sort)
    -> format of recursive function:
    -> recursive case: the case where function will recur
    -> base case: the case where function will not recur
    -> recursion vs iteration:
    -> time: recur take more time becaouse it needs to access the stack memory to push and pop the recorsive method calls, hence it more time than iteration
    -> space efficiency: recur takes more space than iteration, as it store multiple method calls in stack memory
